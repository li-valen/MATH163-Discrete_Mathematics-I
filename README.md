## MATH 163 — Discrete Mathematics

### Overview
This repository tracks course materials, notes, and progress for MATH 163. The course follows "Discrete Mathematics and its Applications (8th ed.)" by Kenneth H. Rosen. Below is the planned coverage and a snapshot of current grades.

### Coverage Plan (by Chapter/Section)

- **Applications of Propositional Logic**: Translating English to logic, system specifications.
- **Propositional Equivalences**: Logical equivalences, De Morgan's laws, constructing equivalences.
- **Predicates and Quantifiers**: Predicates, ∀ and ∃, translating between English and quantified expressions.
- **Nested Quantifiers**: Quantifiers within the scope of other quantifiers.
- **Rules of Inference**: Valid arguments in propositional and predicate logic.
- **Introduction to Proofs**: Terminology, theorems/conjectures, direct proof, contraposition, vacuous and trivial proofs.
- **Proof Methods and Strategy**: Proof by contradiction, existence/uniqueness proofs, backward reasoning, counterexamples.

#### Chapter 2: Basic Structures — Sets, Functions, Sequences, Sums, and Matrices (2.1–2.6)
- **Sets**: Set notation, equality, subsets, Venn diagrams.
- **Set Operations**: Union, intersection, difference, complement, identities, generalized unions/intersections.
- **Functions**: Function basics, injective/surjective/bijective, inverses, composition.
- **Sequences and Summations**: Sequences, arithmetic/geometric progressions, recurrence relations, sigma notation and properties.
- **Cardinality of Sets**: Countable vs uncountable.
- **Matrices**: Addition, scalar/matrix multiplication, transpose, zero–one matrices.

#### Chapter 6: Counting (6.1–6.5)
- **Basics of Counting (6.1)**: Product/sum rules, trees, inclusion–exclusion for two sets.
- **Pigeonhole Principle (6.2)**: Standard and generalized forms.

- **Binomial Coefficients and Identities (6.4)**: Binomial Theorem, Pascal's Identity, combinatorial proofs.
- **Generalized Permutations and Combinations (6.5)**: With repetition; distributing objects into boxes.

#### Chapter 7: Discrete Probability (7.1–7.4)
- **Introduction (7.1)**: Events, complements, conditional probability, independence.
- **Probability Theory (7.2)**: Bayes' Theorem, Bernoulli trials, Binomial distribution.
- **Expected Value and Variance (7.4)**: Expectation, linearity, variance, standard deviation.

### Repository Guide
- `HW_1.pdf`: First homework PDF.
- Future folders may include `notes/`, `assignments/`, and `scripts/` for problem checks.

### How to Contribute/Use
- Add new materials and solutions under clearly named directories.
- Keep proofs clear and prefer readable math notation; when coding, follow a clean, well-documented style.
